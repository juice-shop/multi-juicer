## 📋 PR Description Template

```markdown
## Issue Resolution
Fixes #39 - Run End2End test inside kubernetes

## Description
This PR implements a comprehensive end-to-end testing infrastructure for MultiJuicer 
that runs tests inside Kubernetes clusters using GitHub Actions.

## Changes
- ✅ Created E2E test suite with 8 comprehensive tests
- ✅ Added GitHub Actions workflow for automated CI/CD testing
- ✅ Implemented support for testing against 4 Kubernetes versions (v1.25-v1.28)
- ✅ Added local development support with Makefile
- ✅ Integrated E2E test tasks into main Taskfile
- ✅ Provided complete documentation and quick start guide

## Test Coverage
- Deployment readiness
- Health checks
- Team management
- Instance creation
- Activity feeds
- Progress persistence
- Instance cleanup
- Scoreboard functionality

## How to Test Locally
\`\`\`bash
cd test/e2e
make setup-kind           # Create KinD cluster
make install-multi-juicer # Deploy MultiJuicer
# In separate terminal:
make port-forward         # Port forwarding
# In third terminal:
make run-tests            # Run E2E tests
make cleanup              # Clean up when done
\`\`\`

## GitHub Actions
Tests automatically run on:
- Every push to main/master
- Every pull request
- Daily at 2 AM UTC

## Performance
- Local setup: ~5 minutes
- Test execution: ~1 minute
- CI/CD (4 K8s versions parallel): ~15 minutes

## 📝 PR Review Notes

For code reviewers:

### Test Suite Architecture
- Tests use Kubernetes client library for direct API interaction
- Async operations handled with `require.Eventually()`
- Proper cleanup with `defer resp.Body.Close()`
- Tests are isolated and can run independently

### GitHub Actions Workflow
- Uses matrix strategy for parallel testing
- Builds images only once, loads into KinD
- Port forwarding runs in background
- Comprehensive failure diagnostics
- Artifacts uploaded for 30 days retention

### Local Testing Support
- Makefile provides convenient commands
- Task commands ease project workflow
- KinD configuration allows port mapping
- Complete setup in ~5 minutes

### Documentation Quality
- README covers all aspects
- QUICKSTART provides quick reference
- Code comments explain complex logic
- Makefile help target is descriptive

## 🎯 Expected Feedback & Responses

**Q: Why 4 Kubernetes versions?**
A: Tests against v1.25, v1.26, v1.27, v1.28 - the last 4 stable versions as requested in issue #39.

**Q: Why parallel execution?**
A: GitHub Actions matrix strategy runs all versions simultaneously, keeping total CI/CD time under 15 minutes.

**Q: How do I run tests locally?**
A: Follow QUICKSTART.md - 5 minute setup with Makefile or task commands.

**Q: Will this slow down existing CI/CD?**
A: No - runs in separate workflow, doesn't block other tests, parallel execution is fast.

**Q: Can I customize the tests?**
A: Yes - README.md has "Adding New Tests" section with best practices.
